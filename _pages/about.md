Hi! I’m Zhongyu Yang (杨忠裕), a third-year undergraduate student at School of Mathematics and Statistics, Lanzhou University, majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Currently, I am working as a research asssistant at CUHKSZ ,advised with [Ruimao Zhang](http://www.zhangruimao.site/), studying AI for Science and Computer Vision.

I intend to pursue my Ph.D. degree now.

My research interests include Energy Economics ,computer vision and AI for Science (Medical). You may relate to [my personal CV](https://01yzzyu.github.io/yzzyu.github.io/assets/CV.pdf) for more information. 

Outside of research, I’m a big fan of the Los Angeles Lakers. My GOATs are Lionel Messi⚽ and LeBron James🏀 in their respective fields. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball🏀 a lot.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or collaborate yangzhy21@lzu.edu.cn.

Renewable energy(SCI Q1 TOP)

Abstract:The considerable increase in municipal waste has become a primary global concern due to the contamination of the environment through the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, many OECD countries have adopted municipal waste management practices. This study is a baseline attempt to explore the long-term effect of municipal waste management along with the energy transition, environmental innovation, and environmental policy stringency on GHG emissions in ten OECD countries from 1994 to 2020. This objective is realized by using non-parametric panel quantile regression. The estimated result reveals the asymmetric effect of selected explanatory variables on GHG emissions at various quantiles. The findings show that an increase in municipal waste can increase GHGs emissions at lower quantiles, while an insignificant effect is observed at higher quantiles. Similarly, energy transition, environmental innovation, and environmental policy stringency reveal asymmetric effects across the quantiles. The findings urge OECD countries to adopt more efficient municipal waste management practices and encourage renewable energy transition and environmental innovation. Environmental policy stringency can also be instrumental in enhancing environmental sustainability.

Green Effect of Energy Transition Policy: A quasi-natural Experiment Based on New Energy Demonstration Cities

Zhichao Yu,Wenlan Xie,Junjie Guo,Zhongyu Yang*

Revision Submitted(Finance Research Letters , SSCI Q1 1/111)

Abstract:Amid China's rapid urbanization, this study evaluates the New Energy DemonstrationCities initiative for sustainable urban development using a quasi-experimental design.It analyzed data from designated cities, finding significant improvements in urban green development, enhanced by government intervention and industrial upgrading,and moderated by financial development. These results challenge broad, non-specific policies and underscore the importance of targeted interventions. This research highlights the critical role of precise, localized energy policies, providing key insights for policymakers and suggesting future research directions in policy effectiveness and environmental management.
