Hi! I’m Zhongyu Yang (杨忠裕), a third-year (senior) undergraduate student at School of Mathematics and Statistics, Lanzhou University, majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Currently, I am working as a research asssistant at CUHKSZ.

I intend to pursue my Ph.D. degree now.

My research interests include Energy Economics ,computer vision and AI for Science (Medical). You may relate to [my personal CV](../assets/CV.pdf) for more information. 

Outside of research, I’m a big fan of the Los Angeles Lakers. My GOATs are Lionel Messi⚽ and LeBron James🏀 in their respective fields. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball🏀 a lot.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or collaborate yangzhy21@lzu.edu.cn.

[Toward enhancing environmental quality in OECD countries: Role of municipal waste, renewable energy, environmental innovation, and environmental policy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2023.05.044) 

Mengying Su, Zhongyu Yang*, Shujaat Abbas, et al.


Abstract:The considerable increase in municipal waste has become a primary global concern due to the contamination of the environment through the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, many OECD countries have adopted municipal waste management practices. This study is a baseline attempt to explore the long-term effect of municipal waste management along with the energy transition, environmental innovation, and environmental policy stringency on GHG emissions in ten OECD countries from 1994 to 2020. This objective is realized by using non-parametric panel quantile regression. The estimated result reveals the asymmetric effect of selected explanatory variables on GHG emissions at various quantiles. The findings show that an increase in municipal waste can increase GHGs emissions at lower quantiles, while an insignificant effect is observed at higher quantiles. Similarly, energy transition, environmental innovation, and environmental policy stringency reveal asymmetric effects across the quantiles. The findings urge OECD countries to adopt more efficient municipal waste management practices and encourage renewable energy transition and environmental innovation. Environmental policy stringency can also be instrumental in enhancing environmental sustainability.
