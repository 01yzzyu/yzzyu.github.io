Hi! I’m Zhongyu Yang (杨忠裕), a final year undergraduate student at Lanzhou University, majoring in Mathematics(the Basic Theory Class). Currently, I am working as a Remote Intern at KAUST [Vision-Cair](https://vision-cair.kaust.edu.sa/).

My research interests include 2D/3D AIGC; Multimodal understanding, generation, and interaction; and Energy Economics. You may relate to my personal [CV](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01yzzyu/yzzyu.github.io/master/assets/Resume.pdf) or [CV_CN](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01yzzyu/yzzyu.github.io/master/assets/Resume_CN.pdf) for more information. 

In my past research, I am most interested in 2D/3D AIGC. In the short term, I hope to make a controllable and editable generative model to understand better multimodal input, not just prompt and visual encoder. 
My long-term research goal is to develop intelligent machines that can actively perceive, analyze, and interpret human states, behaviors, and potential motivations in dynamic scenes.
Outside of research, I’m a big fan of the Los Angeles Lakers. My GOATs are Lionel Messi⚽ and LeBron James🏀 in their respective fields. 

Looking for a PhD position now.

Feel free to reach out if you want to WeChat(13437555149) or collaborate with yangzhy21@gmail.com.
